# Bookmark Folder Manager - React - Ant Design

## Introduction ✨

Concept of a Bookmark Folder Manager. My goal is to make something similar to Opera GX's bookmark manager but with more advanced options and greater customization per user.

The idea is to be able to manage your bookmarks in one account, organize them depending on your needs, be able to share your folders with other people, among other things.

The menu and several elements of the project were created with Ant Design. Honestly, Antd is an amazing tool for creating simple interfaces, but when it comes to editing styles, it's a pain in the head. I'll replace it in the future.

And yes, the application is in the form of a folder.
